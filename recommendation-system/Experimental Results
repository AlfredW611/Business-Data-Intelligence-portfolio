This part was not fully explained in the Q&A session, and I saw the feedback of my Q&A session,
so I will provide more details here. Overall, the recommendation system can run end-to-end
and generate product recommendations, which can be regarded as a basic model. Although the
scores are still not high, they show a clear improvement compared with the baseline.

From the baseline results, where only a cosine similarity model was used to recommend
six products, the evaluation scores were Precision@6 = 0.000542, Recall@6 = 0.000380, and
MAP@6 slightly better at 0.001091. In the final evaluation, under the hybrid recommendation
that combines the three methods, all metrics showed significant improvement, with MAP@6
reaching 0.259. Compared with the baseline, the value grew by about 235 times, indicating
relatively reasonable performance in ranking recommended items.

However, Precision@6 and Recall@6 were 0.043 and 0.033 respectively. While still relatively
low, they represent clear improvements over the baseline. The final MAP@6 score of the hybrid
recommendation means that if a customer purchased 30 products, only 1 of them appeared in
the Top-K recommendation list. Considering the small size of the experimental subset and the
extremely large recommendation space (over 100,000 products), these results provide valuable
reference. The specific values can be found in the supplement materials.

The repeat-based recommendation method (Feature One) can ensure partial hits but has
a limited recommendation scope. The content-based recommendation method (Feature Two)
expands the diversity of recommendations but shows lower precision. The sequential-based rec-
ommendation method (Feature Three) has certain advantages in recall, making it suitable for
capturing short-term trends. The hybrid recommendation method combines the strengths of
all three approaches.

Since only a subset of 10,000 customers was used, the results may di”er from experiments
conducted on the full dataset. Final recommendation system result is better than the baseline.
In addition, the evaluation was limited to basic o!ine testing, the model design is relatively
simple and has not yet incorporated more advanced deep learning methods, leaving significant
room for improvement in both precision and recall. To further enhance performance, it will be
necessary to integrate richer features and more sophisticated algorithms.
